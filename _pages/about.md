I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/), working in quantum information theory in a project lead by [Cihan Okay](https://www.cihanokay.com/). I received my doctorate in Mathematics from Bilkent in January 2023, advised by [Ozgun Unlu](http://www.fen.bilkent.edu.tr/~unluo/). 

My research interests lie in the interaction between category theory and algebraic topology. More specifically, I am interested in homotopy coherent categories and
operads. I also have an interest in categorical quantum theory.
